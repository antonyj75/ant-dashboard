Welcome to the Ant Dashboard that demonstrates running splunk search queries and displaying results.

This dashboard code was tested with splunk enterprise 6.3.0 on Ubuntu 14.04.

Gotchas:
* The dashing framework requires a JavaScript runtime to be installed in the system.
I used Node.js while testing the dashboard code.
